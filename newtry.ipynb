sick mindbr br i do know that i will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by jennifer chambers lynch she is a sick twisted foulmouthed foulthinking deviant she looks

section of surveillance the watched are watching you can see and hear her for yourself she was every bit as bad as i had envisioned from the writing of this moviebr br im not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor this goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any p0rn film the level of implied sadoviolence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards this perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says another reviewer found the description i was seeking this is a snuff filmbr br be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending this directorwriter is truly a sick person i cant believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it you can be assured that i will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with in the thousands of movies i have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott she is offensive beyond anyone i have ever seen connected with filming a movie before there have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mindbr br when i saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killersbr br as i saw the serial killers reveal themselves i began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie those were my actual thoughts as i watched this movie i fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for longterm psychiatric treatment to my surprise it turned out to be the director when i saw and heard what she had to say on the dvd i realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose on the dvd she was indeed the sick twisted person i had envisioned writing such a disturbing filmbr br while the little girl stephanie ryan simpkins truly stole the show i cant believe that her reallife parents would have tolerated this sick foulmouthed director to be anywhere near their daughterbr br this movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the directorwriter needs some serious treatment in a mental facilitybr br as far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal there was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character im stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie the trailer was completely misleading the only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer that trailer is not representative of the movie you will seebr br other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writerdirector who created them but if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert im not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the canadian town in the special features section of the dvdbr br this writerdirector has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps the only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child watch closely and you will see this in every character then listen to the directorwriter talk on the dvd special features section and you will understand what im telling you about her mental state and psychological issues she wouldnt be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a hollywood film making familybr br fortunately jennifer chambers lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles i dont think well have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director david lynch helps her out id recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and im not too sure her dads films would be any betterbr br do yourself a favor avoid anything written or directed by jennifer

collective indian culture but why what is it about the female gender that has rendered it so hateful to the culture that women are routinely subject to the most unimaginable horrors including rape murder infanticide imposed illiteracy infidelity and the subjugation of spirit that goes under the name of dowry rajkumar santoshis latest offering lajja asks the same plaintive question linking the atrocities committed against women through three separate chaptersepisodes which comprise the journey of shame endured by its protagonist vaidehi manisha koiralabr br direction on santoshis part is not up to par with the level the story demands he fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity in depicting the saga of sadness and confronts the issue of misogyny from the side instead of headon santoshi has recently said that he did not make the film for an international film festival but rather for the masses of his country regrettably the tackiness shows and the film too often delves into the actionbloodgore genre that santoshi specializes in the film suffers from its jerky episodic pace and its ending is rather too contrivedbr br the female cast is given much kinder and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts the protagonist is played sensitively by the luminescently beautiful manisha koirala who proves in lajja that she is one of our times more competent leading ladies and given a proper role and set up emerges with a truly commendable performance one wonders how brilliantly she may have shone had the film been made by a director with the appropriate creative intention and appreciation of the issue at hand mahima choudhary puts in a laudable performance and continues to show that she is an untapped talent cast as janki madhuri dixit performs with a neverbeforeseen fervor and felicity for what truly deserves the name of acting the role of a street smart performer who finds solace in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her cannon of songndance roles which have maintained her marquee status over the past decade which leaves the final and most disturbing performance in this wouldbe feminist saga that of the ceaselessly talented rekha lajja is manisha koiralas film there can be no doubt about that but it is rekha who dominates the proceedings in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the vestibules of your heart rekha dazzles as ramdulari foregoing vanity and complacency to deliver a performance that is so replete with authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this portion of the film comparisons are indeed odious especially when rendered opposite one of the worlds great leading ladies but in the gracious presence of this reigning screen legend the others fade in her shadowbr br lajja has none of the sophistication of protofeminist dramas like zubeidaa pinjar or even the hellqueen celebration laadla it fulfills its feministic goals in two early momentsthe loud tirade in which mahima berates her inlaws for their abuse of her father who has committed no other crime than given birth to a girl she erupts leaving the wedding procession in shambles seeing her father devastated she begins to weep blaming herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her she bemoans why did i say anything i have ruined everything it is all my fault her grandmother witnessing silently the abuse she bore comforts her by saying why are you crying there is no reason for you to be crying you are not at fault for anything the fault is mine the fault is of every woman who came before you because if we had had the courage to say in our day what you have said today there would have been no need for you to say anything today in this scene the importance of the feminist legacy is laid plainly in sight through wordsbr br the other more subtle moment comes very early in the film when vaidehi manisha has fled from her abusive husband to the refuge of her parents home in india to viewers of western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable indeed natural that any abused woman would seek the protective guardianship of her parents this however is a societal taboo in many eastern cultures india among them once a woman has been married the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal assets family business children etc for her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a grave social sin one which truly has no equivalent for the western woman she is thereafter regarded as tainted and as damaged goods one whose value has been nullified entirely by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given she is not so much an individual as she is an emblem of familial honor her father rebukes her for her actions concerned that his familial honor will be tarnished irreparably by the daughter he had already transferred to another man his primary concern is that of the impending marriage of vaidehis younger sister a prospect made far less likely with a divorced elder daughter in the same household he tells her in no uncertain that she must return to the man to whom she lawfully belongs however violent and sadistic he may be he levies against her the age old adage that the honor of every home lies in the hands of its daughter quietly and pensively she

what does the police officer do knowing that something is seriously wrong he goes up and calmly talks to the killer who nicole had even pointed out to be the guy who was stalking her and buys into the killers lie that he was simply driving through and needed directions seriously the cop then talks to nicole outside totally unaware as the pickup truck turns around and runs him overbr br the cop quickly starts telling nicole that hes a goner whos lucky to be breathing still yet he strangely doesnt die for quite a while the two of them do some more pointless talking and the allimportant fact that he has a gun is annoyingly not even mentioned for too long a time when the two of them finally try to use the gun nicole stupidly wastes most of her bullets blindly shooting at a door when the killer was possibly behind it with two bullets left the policeman tells nicole to use one to euthanize him she fires one into his mouth and he lays still for a few moments with a chunk blown out of his head then he suddenly and inexplicably yells out you missed and she has to shoot him again completely cheap attempt at shockbr br nicole finally confronts the killerâand fails the movie ends with a scene taking place not long from then with a woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop in the bathroom building she hears nicole crying for help in the closet locked in like

       " 'theres something going on in this film directed by xfiles scribe john shiban that has eluded me you get that feeling as the film moves that everything is not what it seems yet i feel the movie fails at giving you enough to go on to truly care afterward its about perception there are characters the heroine nicolejaimie alexandermeets in the film that she talks to that up and vanish this might seem like a spoiler but its something that really only inherits a wee bit of focus on the filmmakers part they seem to be poking fun at us as we watch curious at whether we should trust what nicole is seeing or not it never gets a proper answer and i for one was a bit clueless at the point there comes a time in a film when ambiguity can just be frustrating because the viewer is led on a wild goose chase that ends at a dead end with little explanation at what we just sawit ultimately feels like an exhausting exercise instead of a thrilling psychodrama now theres nothing wrong with ambiguity itself but give us something to latch onto or you will evade us thats how i felt as i watched rest stop this film is supposedly about a young woman named nicole who decides to run off to california with lover jessejoey mendicinoto make it big in hollywood they make what is supposed to be a slight detour at a rest stop so that nicole can pee but it descends into terror for her when she finds that her jesse is completely missing someone in a crusty dusty yellow truck is a nut job who seems to be causing a lot of trouble to nicole and we soon realize that he is behind jesses disappearance when things start to occur signs provided to her if you will she will have to find a way out of a very difficult situation nicole is far from any existing town and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who provides her with some strong evidence of how evil he can bebr br thats the easy part when a female character comes into play the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic as we are not sure where she ever came from how she got there and more importantly where she goes once nicole tries to break her free from her supposed prison in the restrooms utilities cabinet she meets another a police officer in the areajoey lawrence who might seem like her savior but when he too is a victim of the truck driver startling things occur again that questions if he was ever actually even there to begin with the truck driver commits torturous acts to nicolelike holing her up in the restroom and as she tries to untie a wire that the killer has wrapped around the door lock she receives a nasty bite from him he then sets fire to the restroom leaving her without a lasting place of refuge from the beastbr br its the timing of the truck drivers attacks that has me listless perhaps he just likes tormenting her but he appropriately appears in certain situations where nicole has time to flee or prepare it doesnt make much sense his motives which propel the film into an illogical idea why does he make himself so obvious why does he allow her to prepare it seems im going out on a limb here that he likes having his quarry believe they can find a way of escape only to stomp that hope out when he comes up with his next grisly attack yet why does shiban decide to play with the viewer by having nicole experience odd meetings with people that dont exist what is shiban and the writing team trying to say and to cap off the films unhinged weirdness is a family in a rv they play a small part in the scheme of things as religious bigots themselves but the film doesnt do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this film at all',\n",
       " 'a young woman nicole carrow jaimie alexander and her boyfriend jess joey mendicino become targets for a deranged serial killer after stopping for a comfort break at a remote roadside reststopbr br what might have been an effectively scary chiller in more competent hands turns out to be a confusing illconsidered mess under the sloppy direction of john shiban who also wrote the screenplay there is a good deal of juicy violence a brief smattering of nudity and confident performances from the cast but the silly script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions one cannot help but feel disappointedbr br on the surface the film plays out like a standard clichã©ridden killerontheloose movie but shiban an exwriter for the xfiles throws in some subtle supernatural elements which suggest that his aim was something else entirely a ghost story with the rest stop acting as home to a vengeful spectre out to punish sinnersbr br by reading up on the film checking out viewers theories here on imdb and watching the extras on the dvd certain plot elements begin to make a little more sense although even with the advantage of extra information there are still many questions left unanswered in my opinion any film that requires this much investigation to make itself only partially understood is not particularly a good one',\n",
       " 'ive never made one of these before but this movie was literally so bad i had to say something about itbr br im all for independent filmmaking as the past year has seen of the worst in my opinion of hollywoods showings the mainstream just seems to have lost touch with what making good films is all about that being said movies like this really give independent film a bad reputationbr br the characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with the direction is horrible the plotting is horrible the plot itself is horrible stay away far away only one brief scene featuring a females nude breasts and even that wasnt worth a second lookbr br the scariest thing about this movie is the idea of ever having to watch it again i gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible  it earns one point for each of those traits',\n",
       " 'if you just want gore and nothing but gore and torture youve come to the right movie if you want a at least a sliver of good acting logic story consistencies or even a good guy ending go elsewherebr br i couldnt help but to think to myself jeeeez are those people mentally challenged example after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated the main actress meets a police officer and spills out her story to the cop with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath that drives in a yellow truck the yellow truck pulls up and the officer just walks to it talks to the guy and the truck drives off without any trouble the actress comes out and says why didnt you arrest him and then the truck runs over the police officer after being rammed the truck stops on the road about 20 feet way just standing there while the actress tries to drag the cop away but hes too heavy at the time at that time the truck backs up and runs over the cops leg twice the truck then drives off why didnt the actress get the gun is beyond me which later she shoots the cop in the head twice because the psychopath was about to burn him alive once through the mouth which didnt kill him duuuumb and twice to finish the job roll eyes right after that she turns away to escape the bathroom which was going to explode and when she climbs near the roof she turns around and the cop isnt there anymore okbr br another example the main actress meets a trapped woman in the bathroom she spits out like a gallon of blood on the floor covering about 13s of the room probably more after the main actress goes outside to grab a towel she comes back in and everything is gone  they dont explain why everyone keeps disappearing either dumb dumb dumbbr br i like horrorthrillergore movies but this one was just way too dumb i lost brain cells watching this dribble and you shouldnt too',\n",
       " 'we have given this film one star for awful however it really depends on how you look at it we are currently watching this on channel 5 at 330am and we havent stopped laughing so perhaps we could give it a 10 just for the entertainment value right from the outset with the manic thoughts of the stalker being relayed in comic fashion we were laughing is it me or does that chick from knotts landing look like one of the characters from the dark crystalbr br im not going to spoil it for you however you would have to be pretty stupid not to see it coming i dont think its clever enough for double bluffsbr br this has to be the worstbest film we have ever seen if wed been playing the spot the clichã© drinking game then we be wasted by now',\n",
